# Playstation 3 schematics and board layout

These is a WIP KiCAD project for a custom PS3 motherboard.

I don't know if it's realistic but just maybe it's possible to use a newer CELL and RSX together with the PS2 EE/GS chips, since after all it's just simple PCI between them.

Shoutout to the PS3 dev wiki, it's been incredible helpful so far:
